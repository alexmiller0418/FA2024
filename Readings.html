    <h3>Monochromatic Web Design 09/18</h3>
    <p>What is a Monochromatic Web Design?:
    <ul>
        <li>Contrasting elements using one bold color.</li>
        <li>clean, simple, but memorable calls to action</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>Benefits to Monochromatic Design can include...</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Smaller file sizes making them more easy to share and faster website loads</li>
            <li>Encouraging a call for action where the single color can highlight specific buttons or ask for info from the user.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    Overall monochromatic web designs are growing in popularity because they are simple, straight to the point and are great<br>
    for gathering information from the user. Monochromatic websites are also new and push the more modern minimalistic approach that<br>
    is reflected in hardware, buildings, and other physical works in our world, making it more attractive and contemporary.</p>

    <h3>Attention Economy</h3>

    <p>Some random thoughts I had throughout the reading.</p>

    <p>The word wholly is used a lot in this text. The term wholly implying that something is full, or an entirety of something implies that there is only room for replacement when change happens, instead of building upon.

A natural economy cannot be controlled by information because it is plentiful and economies run on what is scarce. Would information inherently become a scarcity in the economy if given through having one’s attention? Which is a scarcity.

Can certain kinds of information be a scarcity? This question poses a gap that needs to be filled, not necessarily replaced, but in addition to.

“Chatting but not necessarily about anything”
Is attention grabbing just the first step of getting information? When I want information the first step would be to get their attention but that’s not always my end goal. Making the argument that information is secondary. is not always the case, sometimes it is my primary goal but not my first action. </p>
