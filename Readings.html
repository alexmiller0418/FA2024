    <h3>Monochromatic Web Design 09/18</h3>
    <p>What is a Monochromatic Web Design?:
    <ul>
        <li>Contrasting elements using one bold color.</li>
        <li>clean, simple, but memorable calls to action</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>Benefits to Monochromatic Design can include...</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Smaller file sizes making them more easy to share and faster website loads</li>
            <li>Encouraging a call for action where the single color can highlight specific buttons or ask for info from the user.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    Overall monochromatic web designs are growing in popularity because they are simple, straight to the point and are great<br>
    for gathering information from the user. Monochromatic websites are also new and push the more modern minimalistic approach that<br>
    is reflected in hardware, buildings, and other physical works in our world, making it more attractive and contemporary.</p>

    <h3>Attention Economy</h3>

    <p>Some random thoughts I had throughout the reading.</p>

    <p>The word wholly is used a lot in this text. The term wholly implying that something is full, or an entirety of something implies that there is only room for replacement when change happens, instead of building upon.

A natural economy cannot be controlled by information because it is plentiful and economies run on what is scarce. Would information inherently become a scarcity in the economy if given through having one’s attention? Which is a scarcity.

Can certain kinds of information be a scarcity? This question poses a gap that needs to be filled, not necessarily replaced, but in addition to.

“Chatting but not necessarily about anything”
Is attention grabbing just the first step of getting information? When I want information the first step would be to get their attention but that’s not always my end goal. Making the argument that information is secondary. is not always the case, sometimes it is my primary goal but not my first action. </p>

<h3>Interactive Websites 10/25</h3>
    <p>Lirix: This site is well designed in terms of layout. I think the green circle following your curser and disappearing when it is able to click something. I do think that it is misleading for the button to say scoroll as if when you press <br>
        the button it should scroll.<br>
        Samurai: I like how a lot of the imagery builds upon itself, but they should be mpre clear about when there is more information, or where they are placingbthis information.<br>
        Future of Beauty: I liked being able to walk through the images, but I didn't like how I seemed unable to interact with them. <br>
        Weedenseteret: I loved the paralax effect that the screen has as you scroll and when ur curser moves throughout the screen. I think it is a nice way to emphasize the flow throughout the screen and how you move through the site.<br>
        Resn.co.nz: I wasn't a fan of this site, but that is because if i'm going on a website I want it to be informational almost. I think it was just to visually overwhelming for mr. I wanted to know when it would be over.<br>
        Apple:I like how it presents just enough information at a time in increments. I like how the hierarchy of the text is established through opacity, color and weight. The use of the paralax effect feels mpre purposeful.<br>
        The Boat: I think this is the most purposeful use of an interactive website. The motion of the images and video puts emphasis on the story/the plot.<br>
